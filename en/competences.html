            <strong>Pentesting:</strong> <progress value="80" max="100"></progress> 80%<br>
            During the second year of my BUT, I was introduced to pentesting. 
            I had the opportunity to attack 5 virtual machines with different vulnerabilities, 
            which required me to use various tools and think in different ways. 
            For more details on what was done, you can view the project I completed on this topic in the <a href="projet.html#sae_pentest">projects</a> section.
