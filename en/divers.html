            For 10 years now, I have been regularly playing guitar with an academic level of Cycle 2.
            I am capable of playing a wide variety of pieces, and I particularly enjoy Brazilian choros, characterized by their fast rhythm and joyful tones, despite the name meaning "tears".
            I especially enjoy <a href="https://youtu.be/OTIL1MTvcv4?si=TJNY27uYHEt8O75n&amp;t=23" target="_blank"><i>Tico-Tico no FubÃ¡</i> by Zequinha de Abreu</a>.
            The piece I most enjoy playing is <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpeWHtlIsB4" target="_blank"><i>Grand Vals</i> by Francisco TÃ¡rrega</a>.<br><br> 
            Besides guitar, I also enjoy listening to all types of music, particularly 1970s and 1980s rock. 
            The discography of the band Toto is my favorite, but I also appreciate Queen and Pink Floyd.
            My favorite albums are by far <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong> and <strong>Mindfields</strong>.<br><br>

        <h2 class="titre_bloc">Cinema</h2>

        <p class="texte">
            
            Along with music, cinema is another art form I deeply appreciate. My favorite films are "Die Hard" directed
            by John McTiernan, "Nightcrawler" by Dan Gilroy, and the recent "Yannick" by Quentin Dupieux. 
            <br><br>
        
            These three films belong to very different genres but remain great works. The staging and 
            camera movements of the first "Die Hard" redefined the genre until the release of "Die Hard 3", which again
            redefined the codes established by "Die Hard". <br><br>
        
            "Nightcrawler" is a gripping thriller that tells the story of Lou, who roams Los Angeles in search of shocking footage to sell to TV stations. I particularly
            appreciate Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Lou, who becomes obsessed with finding increasingly graphic images, to the point of losing his morality.<br><br>
        
            Finally, "28 Days Later" is a striking post-apocalyptic film that reinvents the zombie genre with intensity. After a devastating virus transforms the population into enraged 
            creatures, Jim, a young courier, awakens from a coma in a deserted and apocalyptic London. He joins a small group of survivors trying to escape the infected and the dangers 
            lurking in this ruined world. The film stands out for its oppressive atmosphere, tense direction, and visceral portrayal of chaos. 
            Danny Boyle skillfully blends horror and drama, enhanced by an immersive soundtrack and a grainy cinematography created by the digital cameras of the time.<br>

            Since my childhood, I have been practicing swimming in a club. 
            After stopping for several years, I resumed this activity this year to stay healthy and engage in physical activity. <br>
            This year, I also started running, again to maintain good health.
