            <strong>August 2023 and 2024: Order Picker</strong><br><br>

            For 1 month, I was employed by the company Gel 43, located in Saint-Germain-Laprade (43), as an order picker.<br><br>
            My job was to prepare frozen goods orders for restaurants or public entities such as hospitals in a cold storage facility, 
            ensuring next-day delivery.<br><br>
            I had the opportunity to discover the working world and learn teamwork with very friendly and understanding colleagues and supervisors.<br><br

            <strong>February 2024: CordÃ©es de la RÃ©ussite</strong><br><br>
            
            During my first year of the University Technology Diploma (BUT), I was selected to participate in the CordÃ©es de la RÃ©ussite program 
            in collaboration with a vocational high school in Clermont-Ferrand (63), to help senior students prepare for their Baccalaureate oral exams.<br><br>
            
            We were a group of three, and we listened to and gave advice to several students to help them improve their oral presentations.
